cursors:
  additional operator for multiple transformations in sequence
    more concise and more efficient
  default void constructor for :=% and friends
    won't be able to support varargs versions, but this is fine
  support non-list pairs

consolidate ui.rkt
  a lot of this is unnecessary

markout:
  design is sucking due to too many special cases; can it be fixed?
  seem to need height management, not just width
    draw tables twice, measuring the first time to provide measurement the second time?
      simplest quick fix; not a long term solution

repr:
  support more types
    booleans
    characters
    strings
  not sure about these
    byte strings
    boxes
    streams
    undefined
  deep aggregate reprs
  generic ordering

kanren:
  disquality based on nested (type, val) representations
    potential to find inequality faster and eliminate redundancies
  redefine < in terms of compare
  remove deps upon use
  convenient admission of function interpretations
  support alternative search strategies
  constraints
    optional occurs-check?

      interesting sub-thread between torkel and pereira
  fix hash unification
  extended aggregate unification?
    sets and hashes with variable keys may have multiple component orderings
      unification could produce multiple possible subs
