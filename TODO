cursors:
  additional operator for multiple transformations in sequence
    more concise and more efficient
  default void constructor for :=% and friends
    won't be able to support varargs versions, but this is fine

consolidate ui.rkt
  a lot of this is unnecessary

markout:
  design is sucking due to too many special cases; can it be fixed?
  seem to need height management, not just width
    draw tables twice, measuring the first time to provide measurement the second time?
      simplest quick fix; not a long term solution

sugar:
  for_
  extend def to support currying syntax
  'values' pattern matching
