Miscellaneous Racket Enhancements
---------------------------------

* records: structs that implement gen:dict keyed on field names
* cursors: an implementation of both zippers and lenses over dicts and lists
* pattern matching everywhere:
  * lambdas, definitions, for loops...
  * match/cata: inspired by [Chez Scheme's Match](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/chezscheme/match/)
* unrestricted generators as in: [Yield: Mainstream Delimited Continuations](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~sabry/papers/yield.pdf)
* algebraic effects and handlers as in: [Eff](http://www.eff-lang.org/)
* monads and do-notation
* awkward syntactic sugar experiments
* other utilities
